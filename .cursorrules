# Cursor Rules for Code Maintenance

1. Every time a new feature is implemented or modified in the codebase:
   - Update MONGODB_COMPAT.md to reflect the changes
   - Mark newly implemented features with [x]
   - Add any new limitations or differences from MongoDB

2. When adding new features:
   - Document the feature in MONGODB_COMPAT.md before implementation
   - Include any MongoDB-specific behaviors that won't be implemented
   - Note any Deno KV-specific limitations or differences

3. When modifying existing features:
   - Update the compatibility notes if behavior changes
   - Document any new limitations or differences
   - Update implementation status if feature support changes

4. Keep the documentation in sync with:
   - Query operators
   - Method implementations
   - Options support
   - Behavioral differences

5. When removing features:
   - Update MONGODB_COMPAT.md to reflect the removal
   - Document the reason for removal
   - Note any alternative approaches

Remember: The compatibility document serves as both a development guide and user documentation. Keep it accurate and up-to-date!
